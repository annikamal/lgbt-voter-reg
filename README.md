# lgbt-voter-reg
This repository displays research determining the frequency of the voter registration behaviors of LGBT+ people and non-LGBT+ people.

My research question is: Does identifying as LGBTQ+ cause lower voter registration and ability to vote in elections overall? My research findings concluded that, yes, identifying as LGBTQ+ can have an effect on the frequency of voter registration. This question is extremely important to ask in terms of how politicians and political candidates, whether it be presidential, governmental, congressional, or local candidates, target LGBTQ+ voters and whether targeting them or not would make a difference in their election results. The hypothesis I planned to test in combination with my research question was that LGBTQ+ people overall register to vote less on average compared to the rest of the general population. An additional hypothesis I wanted to test was that transgender people registered to vote less compared to the rest of the general population, regardless of sexuality.
